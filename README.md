# Candy-Crush-Game
Candy Crush is a  match-three puzzle game. In the game, players complete levels by swapping colored pieces of candy on a game board to make a match of three or more of the same color, eliminating those candies from the board and replacing them with new ones, which could potentially create further matches.
